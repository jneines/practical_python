    "Think of you're running a simulation and like to stop iterating as soon as an error, which you would consider a measure for result quality, drops below a certain threshold. That's the general idea behind most simulations. Repeat some sort of calculations until the result does no longer change from iteration to iteration. The difference in results between two iterations in your program can be such an error, which needs to be as low as possible for reasonable result quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most simulation engines supporting your ideas work that way. You have to write an algorithm in a way that can be optimized. And optimization in this case means that a resulting error needs to be minimized in order to complete.\n",

You can have one single *if*  clause, as many *else if* branches as you desire, also none, and a single *else* branch, which is also optional."

    "A simple `if` clause without any `elif` or `else` is also quite commonly used. The typical pattern here is to update some default value set before with a new value because of a changed condition. Think of some default variable which can be overwritten because of entries in a configuration file, or command line arguments to the program at start time. You often could use an `else` clause in these scenarios as well. The consequence however would possibly be to have a rather long code block indented because of this, right behind a quick and small `if` check. That will end up in not being very readable, and should therefore be avoided.\n",
